ERRATA and changes in new versions of Xtext

General book Errata can be found [here](docs/ERRATA.md).

Changes required by new versions of Xtext are detailed [here](docs/XTEXTVERSIONCHANGES.md). The book was written using Xtext 2.10.0 and some changes were introduced in new versions of Xtext that require some modifications in the sources (and make some parts written in the book not consistent).
